# About 
GT Classic is a combination of content and features from all GregTech's (and some new) arranged into an addon for IC2 Classic 1.12.2.
The goal is create a crossroads where new and old GT players can have a meaningful and unincumbered experience.

# Current State

realeasing alpha downnloads soon for testing.

# Issues
Please report any issues you find to the issue tracker on this repository. Include as much information as possible including as version and steps to reproduce.

# Contribution
Please do! Fork away and PR all you like, my goal after alpha is have contributors filling out content as well as myself. Please do not feel limited to content from previous Gregtechs in your ideas. I just ask that you attempt you integrate your code properly into the existing codebase.
